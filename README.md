 ```
 Rather than making couples by taking girls one by one as in question 1, we create a different mechanism. First one girl chooses a boy, then one boy choses a girl, and so on. The girl list is ordered by maintenance cost, while the boy list is ordered by attractiveness. 
 
 The boys always chose the most attractive available girl which can be seen in the log file as girls' attractiveness value is also printed there. 
 
 The happiest k couples are printed on the screen.
 
 ```
* Events will be logged in log.txt file

* CSV files generated - boys.csv,girls.csv
